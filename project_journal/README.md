Here there be monsters!

* * *

For the longest time, I've been terrified of commiting myself to a project because just like every other poor sod on this planet, I'm afraid of failure. But I need failure. Failure means you're doing something. Doing something means you're learning.

So I'm going to share my process. It's kinda scary. I'm a little intimidated. This is Github, after all. ANYONE can stumble upon this, most of them way smarter and cooler than me. I mean, have you seen some of the awesome stuff people share on here every day?

At any rate, here's my little journal. It's not going to be neatly structured like the rest of the content I've provided. My process is messy. My notebooks are heaps of stream-of-conscious nonsense. Lists without context. Crappy sketches. You've been warned.
