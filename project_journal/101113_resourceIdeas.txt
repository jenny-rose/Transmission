#RESOURCES
To be included on website. Study aids. How to take notes. Organizing. Productivity. Stress-relief. Info not typically available to those who spend little to no time on campus.

I want to keep this section simple. It's really common for people to get obsessed with the details - the tools, the theory, etc. They never get anything done, but it *feels* productive and it's less scary than fully commiting to the things you want to do (and therefore setting yourself up for the possibility of failure). I'm pretty sure there's a term for this (LOOK IT UP).  Keep it simple, stupid! Talk about the few tools that you're fond of.

#####SELF-IMPROVEMENT & GOAL SETTING
+ [16 Habits You Should Do Every Day](http://www.kratosguide.com/16-habits-you-should-do-every-day/) - An interesting article inspired by Benjamin Franklin's 13 Virtues: characteristics and habits that Benjamin Franklin believed were the mark of a well-rounded person.
+ + [Live Like a Hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89) - This article discusses setting long-term goals and spending your energy on the big things in life,  and not worrying about the inconsequential, day-to-day grievances. Encourages you to set monthly goals and actively track your progress. The title refers to the mythical Hydra - if you remove a hydra's head, two return in it's place. Reacting to adversity by coming back stronger, rather than merely "bouncing back" (*"what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"*)

#####ORGANIZATION & PLANNING
+ [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) - If you love making lists, this is the website for you. A simple way to create to-do lists. Works in your browser, so no downloading necessary.
+ [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) - Notetaking. Works in browser, has software for both Windows and Mac, and apps for both Android and iPhone. Write a note on one device, and it will sync across the rest of your devices. You can store and organize PDFs, clip an article on a website via the plugin (great for collecting research for a project), and you can even create and share notebooks (group projects!).
+ [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) - Most people probably keep their to-do lists and apps on their smartphone nowadays, but I still prefer doing things with pen and paper. I have a big notebook that I take everywhere with me, and I put EVERYTHING in it. This is how I organize all that crap I collect, from website ideas to exam dates to notes on the current book I'm reading. Worth looking into if you're also the pen and paper sort.
