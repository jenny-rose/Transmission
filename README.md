# TRANSMISSION

#####ABOUT
In the Soto school of Zen, dharma transmission is an acknowledgement of the connections between teacher and student.

Unfortunately, a lot of students in online courses lack this connection with their peers and instructors. The experience as a whole is very impersonal and cold. With Transmission, I hope to bridge that gap.

For now, this is a small project: a simple website to provide resources, and a private Google+ community to facilitate study groups via Google Hangouts. I really wanted to create a small app utilizing the Google Hangout API, but Transmission is a school project with time constraints at the present moment.

#####CONTEXT
My name is Jenny Coffman, and I'm currently enrolled full-time at Hennepin Technical College for web development.

This website is being created as a part of my final project for a class on critical thinking. We had to find a problem we cared about (something that affected more than just ourselves), and attempt to solve it/put in action using what we've learned in class. I gave myself some additional criteria: this project had to have lasting value. I didn't want to file this away as another frivolous school project. We've all had them. Most of us probably hated them. I took them for granted in high school, and grudgingly gave them a little effort and thought as a photography student at Columbus College of Art and Design. Now, as an non-traditional student in community college, I'm all too aware of the opportunities wasted.

As a number of instructors have pointed out to me over the course of my educational career, you only get what you put in. *Garbage in, garbage out*. 

Programming and design are pure problem-solving. All of the apps on our smartphones, tablets and desktops started as problems to be solved.  Creating a website felt like a natural choice for this project. Not only would it let me flex my coding muscles and provide a piece for my portfolio, but it solves one of the problems within the main problem: encouraging connections between students and instructors *without* sacrificing the convenience of taking an online course. 

I'm going to keep a journal of sorts to document my progress and thought process as I work on this project. You can find it in the `project_journal` folder.

#####CONTACT
I encourage anyone who stumbles upon this to get a hold of me with feedback. I believe constructive criticism and discussion are integral to the learning process.
